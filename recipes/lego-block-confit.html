    <img src="../images/butter-mochi-cakes.png" alt="Butter Mochi Cake" />
    Ingredients:

    12 Lego blocks (washed and sanitized)
    1 cup rendered duck fat
    4 cloves garlic, crushed
    4 sprigs fresh thyme
    1 tsp kosher salt
    1/2 tsp black pepper
    Instructions:
    
    In a small saucepan, combine the duck fat, garlic, thyme, salt, and black pepper. Heat over low heat until the duck fat has melted and the ingredients are well combined.
    Arrange the Lego blocks in a single layer in a baking dish.
    Pour the melted duck fat mixture over the Lego blocks, making sure they are completely submerged.
    Cover the baking dish with foil and place it in the oven. Bake at 250°F (120°C) for 4-6 hours, until the Lego blocks are tender and infused with flavor.
    Once done, remove the baking dish from the oven and allow it to cool slightly.
    Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the Lego blocks from the duck fat and arrange them on a serving platter.
    Serve the Lego Block Confit warm or at room temperature as a whimsical and playful snack.
    Enjoy your playful and slightly silly Lego Block Confit! Just be sure not to step on any leftover Lego blocks lying around on the floor.
