    Ingredients:

    1 head of red cabbage, chopped
    1/2 cup almond flour
    1/2 cup breadcrumbs
    2 eggs
    1 tsp salt
    1/2 tsp black pepper
    1/2 tsp garlic powder
    1/2 tsp onion powder
    1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
    1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
    1/4 cup olive oil
    Instructions:
    
    Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
    In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped red cabbage, almond flour, breadcrumbs, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix well.
    In a separate bowl, beat the eggs.
    Add the beaten eggs to the cabbage mixture and mix thoroughly.
    Stir in the Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley.
    Using your hands, form the mixture into small, bite-sized balls.
    Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the cabbage balls and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden brown.
    Transfer the cabbage balls to a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, until cooked through and crispy.
    Serve the Red Cabbage Treats warm, with your favorite dipping sauce.
    Enjoy your Red Cabbage Treats!
