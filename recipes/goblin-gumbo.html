    <img src="../images/butter-mochi-cakes.png" alt="Butter Mochi Cake" />
    Sure, here is a recipe for an imaginary dish called "Goblin Gumbo" that's
    quite strange and esoteric: Ingredients: 1 pound of goblin toes, finely
    chopped 3 cups of swamp water 2 tablespoons of powdered newt eyes 1 cup of
    crushed beetle shells 1 teaspoon of bat guano 1/4 cup of spider silk 1
    tablespoon of mandrake root Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: Begin by
    carefully selecting your goblin toes, making sure they are fresh and
    properly washed. Finely chop the goblin toes and place them in a large pot.
    Add the swamp water and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to a
    simmer and add the powdered newt eyes, crushed beetle shells, and bat guano.
    Stir the mixture frequently and allow it to simmer for 1 hour. Add the
    spider silk and mandrake root, and continue simmering for an additional 30
    minutes. Season the Goblin Gumbo with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the
    Goblin Gumbo hot in a cauldron or other appropriate vessel. Enjoy your
    Goblin Gumbo, though it is not recommended for those with a weak stomach or
    aversion to unconventional ingredients.
